- Route reconfiguration works only unidirectional

TODO:
- Consume Capability is not selected :: EDIT :: Not in "ExecutionState"-list

- Faults of plants and agents are different
	
	- Drill fault is activated, but the robot still can drill. Maybe because the robot-plant is used instead of the robot agent? :: EDIT :: Yes!
	- "RobotAgent" uses "CanApply" from "Robot" for checking its own "CanApply"-method 

Fault:
- Is the fault-method actually invoked? :: EDIT :: Yes!

Consume-Capability:
Show Counter: One for completed tasks, one for reseted/discarded tasks :: EDIT :: No task is completed, tasks are endless
